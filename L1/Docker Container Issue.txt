#There is a static website running within a container named nautilus, this container is running on App Server 1. 
#Suddenly, we started facing some issues with the static website on App Server 1. Look into the issue to 
#fix the same,you can find more details below:


#1. Container's volume /usr/local/apache2/htdocs is mapped with the host's volume /var/www/html.

#2. The website should run on host port 8080 on App Server 1 i.e command curl http://localhost:8080/ should 
#work on App Server 1.

solution

ssh tony@stapp01
sudo docker ps -a --- to see all containers that exsist
# then we notice that nautilus container has been created or exsists but it is not running, hence the issues
sudo docker start nautilus ---- to start the nautilus container
